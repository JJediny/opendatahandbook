title: API Documentation
---

Quality API documentation is the gateway to a successful API. API documentation needs to be complete, yet simple--a very difficult balance to achieve. This balance takes work and will take the work of more than one individual on an API development team to make happen.

API documentation can be written by developers of the API, but additional edits should be made by developers who were not responsible for deploying the API. As a developer, it’s easy to overlook parameters and other details that developers have made assumptions about.  —*[source](http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html)*
