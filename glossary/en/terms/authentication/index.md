title: Authentication

Authentication is a way for an application or system to associate an account with a user. Usually through credentials in the form of a username and password. Because Basic Auth is integrated into HTTP protocol it is the easiest way for users to authenticate with a RESTful API.

Basic Auth is easily integrated, however if SSL is not used, the username and password are passed in plain text and can be easily intercepted on the open Internet.  â€”*[source](http://management.apievangelist.com/building-blocks.html)*
